# Go-React 
#### A demonstration of using Go FileServer to serve a React application and function as a backend.

This project was valuable to demonstrate the ability of a backend language such as Go to potentially serve a complex frontend in React on specific routes while still funtionaling as a backend server with endpoints for business logic.

Note: In the case of an split-stack application containing a frontend using a framework/library (React, Angular, etc.), it's often simple enough and more efficient to serve those files using a web server such as Nginx or Apache rather than use Go to serve static files.
